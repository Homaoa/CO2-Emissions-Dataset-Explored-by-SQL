# CO2-Emissions-Dataset-Explored-by-SQL

In this project I have used two tables. The format of these tables are excel files that I have imported into SQL to work on. These tables include data on co2 emissions in different countries in different years. Also the GDP and population of these countries in these years are available through these tables.

Data Source: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-vs-gdp

I have explored these tables through different SQL tools including : 
Select, CTE, Join, Delete, Group By, Where,  Order By, Aggregation, Desc, Alter, Drop, Case/End, When, As, In, Like
